# Word-Guess-Game

## Instruction

Hangman is a quick and easy game for at least two people that requires nothing more than the ability to spell. One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by typing what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing. Hangman can also be customized to make the game easier, harder, or educational, and there are apps and websites to play online if you would like.
